## Ping

- This command shows the following developer information:
  - Package versions, memory usage, system information, and cpu information.

## Support

You can use the `/support` command to join the support server.

The support server is a place where you can ask questions and get help.

You can also give suggestions, bug reports, feedback, and more.

## Eval

You can use the `/eval <code>` command to evaluate code.

This command is used to evaluate code. It is only available to the bot owner.

The bot owner can use this command to evaluate code, such as to get the output of a function.
